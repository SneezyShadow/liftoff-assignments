## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The project I will be working on is a table top hosting site. The purpose of this site is to allow users to connect with their friends and other users to enjoy a variety of table top game from tic-tac-toe to Monopoly. The reason I'm building this is for my friends. We adore table top games but we aren't located next to each other. This site will allow us to play those games without having to set a meet-up date that we can all abide by.
### Features
User login: User will be able to create and login to an account and customize their homepage accordingly.
Create Public and Private Rooms: Users can create public rooms that other users can search for and find or private rooms that are only available to users with a room key.
Search: Users will be able to search for rooms based on criteria and friends based on username.
Friends: Users will be able to add other users into their friend group if both users agree.
Chat: Users will be able to chat among themselves in public and private chatrooms or privately with a friend on their friend list.
Play Simple Games: users within a room will be able to play simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe or chess.

### Technologies
The technology I will be using as of current will be Java, Springboot, Hibernate, MySQL, and Thymeleaf.
### What I'll Have to Learn
My current problem is having users appear in rooms dynamically. I will try to find a way to fix this problem most likely through javascript.
